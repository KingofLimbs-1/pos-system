# pos-system

## Description

This challenge requires you to build a POS system. A user may select items from a menu and add them to an order. The menu will be supplied to you, in the form of a PHP associative array. The app should have two main sections/pages:

- a menu section where menu items are displayed and where the current total of a user's order is displayed.

- a payment section which displays a list of items in the order, adds VAT to the total of the order, and finally displays the sub-total of the order the user is expected to pay.
